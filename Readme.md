# ALIA LOOKS LIKE ME!

Since the birth of my daughter, Alia, exactly 2 months ago, everyone keeps saying she looks like my wife and less so like me, and I've had it with the propaganda.

In this repository, I aim to MATHEMATICALLY PROVE that my daugher actually looks like me. Thus proving that I am also cute and pretty.

## Methodology
I'll explore multiple face recognition, feature extraction, classification, and clustering models to see who they agree with, AND THEN ONLY HIGHLIGHT THE ONES THAT AGREE WITH ME!

This is going to be a long-running project where I try out new methods as I find them interesting (and find the time to do so between diaper changes), and keep evaluating all methods observed thus far wih newer pictures as my little one grows up (TO LOOK MORE AND MORE LIKE ME!)

## Used Methods
This will have a list of used models so far, along with their results.
- Facenet with MTCNN

## Results
A list of results observed across different models and through time

## References
Here is a list of the resources that I've found useful in this endeavor
 - https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch. A PyTorch implementation of facenet and MTCNN, this is my starting point.
